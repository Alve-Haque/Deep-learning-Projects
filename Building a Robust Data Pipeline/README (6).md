# 🚀 Building a Robust Data Pipeline

A well-structured, scalable, and efficient **data pipeline** is the backbone of any successful machine learning system.  
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a **robust end-to-end data pipeline** using Python and PyTorch, from raw data ingestion to batched data loading for model training.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **clean, modular, and reusable data pipeline** that:

- Handles raw data efficiently  
- Performs structured preprocessing  
- Implements a custom dataset abstraction  
- Integrates seamlessly with PyTorch’s `DataLoader`  
- Is suitable for real-world machine learning workflows  

This notebook is designed with **best practices in ML engineering** in mind and can be easily extended for different datasets and models.
