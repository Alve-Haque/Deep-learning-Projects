Build a model that predicts delivery times across a city’s network. Starts with raw delivery data and engineer a new feature that captures hidden patterns in city traffic. With this enhanced data, I have constructed and train a multi-layer neural network that learns from multiple real-world factors at once. By the end, I have built a complete solution from data preparation to prediction, capable of generating accurate delivery estimates for any new order.
