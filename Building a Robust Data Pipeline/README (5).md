# 🚀 Building a Robust Data Pipeline

> A well-structured, end-to-end data pipeline demonstrating data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and validation using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **robust and reusable data pipeline** that can handle real-world data challenges such as missing values, inconsistent formats, and transformation logic.

The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and ease of understanding.

*(Suggested: a high-level flow diagram or main output visualization)*

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a reliable end-to-end data pipeline
- Handle raw and inconsistent data gracefully
- Apply systematic data cleaning and transformations
- Validate data quality at each stage
- Produce analysis-ready output data

```

*(Suggested: block diagram or step-by-step pipeline visualization)*

### Key Stages

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Load raw data from source
   - Initial validation of structure and schema

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing and null values
   - Remove duplicates
   - Correct data types and formats

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Feature engineering
   - Scaling and normalization
   - Column transformations

4. **Validation & Quality Checks**
   - Integrity constraints
   - Logical consistency checks
   - Error handling mechanisms

5. **Final Output**
   - Clean, structured dataset ready for downstream use
