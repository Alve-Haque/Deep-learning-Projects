# **Deep Learning Projects**

A comprehensive collection of my deep learning projects across computer vision, natural language processing, time-series modeling, and hybrid neural network architectures. Each project includes well-structured code, datasets (or links), model training scripts, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.


##  **Overview**

This repository consolidates the deep learning work I have completed over time. It includes implementations of:

EEG/ECG signal classification

Seizure detection with onset/offset estimation

Image classification and segmentation

Text classification using sequence and transformer models

Time-series forecasting

Generative modeling (GANs, VAEs)

Experimental architectures and ablation studies

The goal of this repository is to provide high-quality, reproducible, and modular deep learning solutions.
